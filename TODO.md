## Incremental TODOs for aido1_LF1:

Simulator:

* Make Duckiebot start more or less in the right direction; too much variability now.
* Log position in the lane, current tile etc. *Please use traditional x,y,z coordinate frame (z up, x front, y left)*.

Scorer:

* Add score: length traveled
* Add score: violation of "direction of travel" rule.


## TODO for next revision (aido1_LF2)

* Simulate distorted images 640x480.
* Many more episodes simulated.
